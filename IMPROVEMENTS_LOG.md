# FLOW Application - Improvements & Bug Fixes Log

## 🎯 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. ✅ Starfield Mode Not Moving
**Problem:** Stars were not moving, acceleration wasn't working
**Solution:**
- Increased movement speed multiplier from 20 to 50
- Properly initialized `currentSpeed` and `targetSpeed` in init()
- Fixed speed interpolation smoothing (increased from 3 to 5)
- Stars now move smoothly and accelerate correctly on interaction

**File:** `src/core/visuals/modes/StarfieldMode.ts`

### 2. ✅ FPS Drops to 5 Frames
**Problem:** Severe performance degradation causing unplayable experience
**Solutions Applied:**
- Reduced default particle counts across all modes (50-60% reduction)
  - Toroid: 5000 → 2000
  - Weaver: 3000 → 1500
  - Starfield: 5000 → 3000
  - Matrix: 100 → 80
  - Orbs/Crawl: 200 → 150
- Implemented aggressive FPS monitoring (responds faster to drops)
- Added tab visibility detection (pauses rendering when tab hidden)
- Capped delta time to prevent huge animation jumps
- Removed expensive connection lines from Weaver mode
- Added particle count caps in modes (max 5000)
- Improved update loop optimizations (pre-calculated values)

**Files:** 
- `src/store/useAppStore.ts`
- `src/core/performance/PerformanceMonitor.ts`
- `src/hooks/useVisualMode.ts`
- `src/core/visuals/modes/WeaverMode.ts`

### 3. ✅ Audio Bar Not Properly Positioned
**Problem:** Audio controls weren't staying fixed at top-right
**Solution:**
- Increased z-index from 50 to 98
- Added `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to ensure clickability
- Made responsive for mobile (shows only icons, text hidden)
- Added flexWrap for multi-line on small screens

**File:** `src/ui/components/AudioControls.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Non-Responsive Mobile Layout
**Problem:** UI was not adapted for mobile devices
**Solutions:**
- Converted Settings drawer to bottom sheet on mobile
- Added drag handle for swipe-to-close
- Increased touch target sizes (sliders 4px → 8px, thumbs 20px → 28px)
- Made all text/buttons larger on mobile
- Added responsive breakpoints throughout UI
- Mode selector dots smaller and tighter spacing on mobile

**Files:**
- `src/ui/components/QuickSettings.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/AudioControls.tsx`
- `src/ui/components/ModeSelector.tsx`
- `src/index.css`

### 5. ✅ Inconvenient Mobile Settings
**Problem:** Desktop-style drawer was hard to use on mobile
**Solution:**
- Complete redesign as bottom sheet
- Swipe down to close functionality
- Drag handle visual indicator
- Larger sliders with gradient thumbs
- Clearer labels with colored values
- Performance warnings for high particle counts
- Mobile-specific padding for safe areas

**File:** `src/ui/components/QuickSettings.tsx`
